## VOYAGEVERT CONCEPT

The concept for the VoyageVert web application comes from a need to validate an existing business idea, which has been worked on with the business owner's permission. The existing website for [VoyageVert](www.voyagevert.org) set outs the business vision for a future of sustainable ocean travel using high-speed yachts to replace air travel. One key aspect to moving the business forward is to demonstrate the demand for the service to investors.

This VoyageVert web application is designed to gather the user information to validate the business concept. The web app can be used as a landing page as part of a marketing campaign to engage users, gather user information and to test consumer interest in certain routes of travel and potential dates of travel.
